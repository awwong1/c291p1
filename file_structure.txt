public static void main(String args[])
       contains: 
       		 connection to jdbc driver
		 loop for ujiji options: '0' for logout, '1' for post ad, '2' for 
		      list own ads,'3' for search ads, '4' for search users

public static String logchoice(): 
       - This function allows users to login or register as a new user
       - Display all reviews between last_login and current system time 
       	       where reviewee = email
       - Register user screen here, ask for new email and pass
ALEX TODO:: NOTE: Currently, length is not restricted. Will be cut off in SQL statememnt 
       execution
       Alex: This has been fixed as on March 8, 2013

public static void logout():
       -  Logs out of the system, sets current system time to last_login

public static void own_ads():
       - displays a user's own ads
       - asks user if they want to delete an ad, or promote it
MICHELLE TODO:
       - Fixed! If user has no ads, it will offer the choice to select 0 for back or 1 
       	 for more ads.
       - Fixed! Pressing 1 continuously means you have to press 0 that many times to go back
       - Fixed! Also, on the last case, it gives the user the option to delete an ad or promote an ad even though there aren't any ads to delete or promote
       - Fixed! When given '0' for back '1' for more ads, user can enter values greater than 1
       - Fixed! When entering characters, conversion throws error and breaks rather than prompt to try again

public static void own_ad_print(ResultSet rset):
       - prints ads from own_ads() ResultSet in multiples of 5
       - asks to print more in multiples of 5
MICHELLE TODO:
       - Fixed! Breaks when user has no ads to print
       - Fixed! Perhaps display column headers for each column?

public static void ad_promote(ResultSet rset):
       - promotes an ad, as selected by user
MICHELLE TODO:
       - Fixed! promoting an add throws "Selection was out of scope" error

public static void ad_delete(ResultSet rset):
       - Deletes a specific ad, as selected by user
MICHELLE TODO:
       - Fixed! deleting an add throws "Selection was out of scope" error

public static void ad_search():
       - Finds an ad based on keywords entered
MICHELLE TODO:
       - Pressing '0' does not go back. (Did you intend for this?) Yes.  Just enter a 
       	 keyword and then go back afterwards
       - Fixed! When a garbage keyword is entered, and an empty result set is returned, 
         a user will still be allowed to press '1' for more ads.
	 Fixed! However, a user must press '0' to go back as many times as they pressed '1'
         On the last iteration, it allows the user to select '1' for more ad detail, despite no ads
       - Using a keyword '0', ads that don't have '0' in title or description appear
       	       - Not true, 0 is in the description or the title
       - Fixed! When selecting an add, after pressing '1' for more detail, and pressing an ad number
         threw an "Selection was out of scope" error, then said "Ad number 3 was deleted"
	 Then it printed out what seemed to be an ad, but it wasn't my selected ad 3 (see attached screenshot)
       - Don't know how to fix this...
       	       Entering a space ' ' character causes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
       - Fixed! When choosing selection, user can enter values out of range
         This occasionally returns the user back to the main menu, occasionally asks the user to select again
	 May also move to the ad_moredetail function (?)

public static void ad_print(ResultSet rset):
       - prints ads in ad_search() ResultSet in multiples of 5
       - asks to print more in multiples of 5

public static void ad_moredetail(ResultSet rset):
       - Provides more detail for a specific ad, as selected by user

public static void user_search():
       - User should be able search by email or search by name
       - If search by name, returns a result of all users with that name; 
       - user should be able to select one from the list.

public static void user_options(String email):
       - This function takes the email given and allows user to choose the following 
       options:
	   1) See all the reviews posted about this email
	   2) Write a review for this email

public static void write_review(String reviewee):
       - This function takes the class global userstate as the reviewer
       and writes a review for the reviewee
       - This function assumes the two emails are valid.
       - This function will not allow a user to write a review for himself.

public static void list_reviews(String reviewee):
       - This function takes the reviewee and prints all the reviews reviewing the reviewee

public static String new_category():
       - This function allows a user to create a new category.
ALEX TODO: specs say users can choose from current categories, nothing about creating new ones
     check forum for more information
     Alex: It's an additional feature, does not detract from the assignment specs.
